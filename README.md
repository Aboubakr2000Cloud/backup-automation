- File compression with tar/gzip
- Backup validation with SHA256 checksums
- Intelligent backup rotation strategies
- Environment variable management
- CLI tool development with argparse
- Production-ready logging and error handling

python backup.py --upload
```

**Disable S3 upload:**
```bash
python backup.py --no-upload
```

**Upload and delete local after verification:**
```bash
python backup.py --upload --delete-local
```

**Configuration (.env):**
```
UPLOAD_TO_S3=true
S3_BACKUP_BUCKET=your-backups-bucket
S3_PREFIX=backups/
S3_RETENTION_DAYS=30
DELETE_LOCAL_AFTER_UPLOAD=false
```

**View help:**
```bash
python backup.py --help
```

## How It Works

### 1. Configuration Validation
- Loads environment variables from `.env`
- Validates all required variables exist
- Checks source directories exist and are readable
- Ensures destination is writable
- Creates destination directory if needed

### 2. Backup Creation
- Generates timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Compresses each source using `tar -czf`
- Creates `.tar.gz` archive with format: `{folder}_{timestamp}.tar.gz`
- Logs compression progress

### 3. Backup Validation
- Verifies archive exists
- Checks file size > 0
- Calculates SHA256 checksum
- Logs validation results

### 4. Manifest Creation
- Creates JSON metadata file
- Includes: filename, source, timestamp, size, checksum
- Saves alongside archive with `.json` extension

**Example Manifest:**
```json
{
    "backup_file": "/home/user/backups/projects_20250208_143025.tar.gz",
    "source": "/home/user/projects",
    "created": "20250208_143025",
    "size_bytes": 16065536,
    "size_human": "15.32 MB",
    "checksum_sha256": "a3f5c89b2e1d4f6c3a8e9b5d2f1a7c4e6b8d3f5a9c2e7b4d1f8a6c3e9b5d2f1a"
}
```

### 5. Uploads to S3 (Optional)
- If enabled, uploads verified backups to S3

### 6. Verifies S3 Upload
- Checks uploaded file matches local checksum

### 7. Organizes S3 Backups
- Stores in date-based structure (2025/02/10/)

### 8. Cleans S3 Backups
- Deletes S3 backups older than S3_RETENTION_DAYS

### 9. Optional Local Cleanup
- Deletes local copy after verified S3 upload
  
### 10. local backup Rotation
- Lists all `.tar.gz` files in destination
- Parses timestamps from filenames
- Identifies backups older than `RETENTION_DAYS`
- **Always keeps at least `MIN_BACKUPS_TO_KEEP`** (even if old)
- Deletes both archive and manifest for old backups
- Logs each deletion

**Rotation Logic:**
```python
# Example: 10 backups, RETENTION_DAYS=7, MIN_BACKUPS=3
# Scenario 1: 8 are old → deletes 7 (keeps 3)
# Scenario 2: 2 are old → deletes 2 (keeps 8)
# Scenario 3: All 10 are old → deletes 7 (keeps 3)
```

### 11. Summary Report
- Total sources processed
- Successful backups
- Failed backups
- Old local backups deleted
- Old S3 backups deleted
- Failed local deletions
- Failed S3 deletions
- Total backup size created

## Output Files

### Archive Files
**Format:** `{folder_name}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.tar.gz`

Example: `projects_20250208_143025.tar.gz`

### Manifest Files
**Format:** `{folder_name}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.json`

Example: `projects_20250208_143025.json`

Contains metadata for verification and tracking.

### Log File
**Location:** `logs/backup.log`

Persistent log of all operations with timestamps.

---

## Error Handling

### Configuration Errors
```
❌ Missing required environment variables: BACKUP_SOURCES
❌ Backup source does not exist: /nonexistent
❌ Backup source not readable: /protected
❌ Backup destination not writable: /readonly
```

**Behavior:** Script exits immediately with clear error message.

### Backup Errors
```
❌ Compressing failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
❌ Archive not found
❌ Archive size is 0
```

**Behavior:** Logs error, marks source as failed, continues to next source.

### Rotation Errors
- Handles missing manifest files gracefully
- Skips rotation if no old backups found
- Continues even if individual deletions fail

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Intelligent Rotation Algorithm
```python
def plan_backup_rotation(backup_dir, retention_days, min_backups):
    # Sorts by time, respects minimum, only deletes old backups
    # Prevents accidental deletion of all backups
```

**Why It's Smart:**
- Never goes below minimum backup count
- Even if all backups are ancient, keeps the newest N
- Protects against misconfiguration

### 2. Separation of Concerns
```python
compress_directory()      # Creates archive
backup_validator()        # Verifies archive
create_backup_manifest()  # Records metadata
plan_backup_rotation()    # Determines what to delete
```

Each function has single responsibility - testable and maintainable.

### 3. Configuration Validation at Startup
```python
validate_required_vars()  # Ensures all config exists
validate_paths()          # Checks filesystem permissions
```

Fail fast with clear errors instead of cryptic failures mid-execution.

### 4. Dry-Run Pattern
```python
if dry_run:
    logger.info("[DRY-RUN] Would compress {source}")
else:
    compress_directory(source)
```

Industry-standard pattern for safe testing of destructive operations.

### 5. S3 Integration with Verification
```python
# Upload with checksum in metadata
s3.upload_file(
    str(archive),
    bucket,
    s3_key,
    ExtraArgs={"Metadata": {"sha256": checksum}}
)

# Verify upload
head = s3.head_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=s3_key)
if checksum == head["Metadata"]["sha256"]:
    # Upload verified!
```
Stores checksum in S3 metadata for integrity verification.

### 6. Date-Organized S3 Structure
```python
def build_s3_key(prefix, archive, dt):
    date_path = f"{dt.year}/{dt.month:02d}/{dt.day:02d}/"
    return f"{prefix}{date_path}{archive.name}"
```
Production pattern: backups/2025/02/10/backup_143022.tar.gz

### 7. Dual Rotation Logic
- Local rotation: Based on file creation timestamp
- S3 rotation: Based on LastModified attribute
- Different retention policies for local vs cloud

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

**1. Basic Functionality**
```bash
# Create test directories
mkdir -p /tmp/test1 /tmp/test2
echo "test" > /tmp/test1/file.txt

# Configure .env
BACKUP_SOURCES=/tmp/test1,/tmp/test2
BACKUP_DESTINATION=/tmp/backups

# Run backup
python backup.py

# Verify: Check /tmp/backups for .tar.gz and .json files
```

**2. Dry-Run Mode**
```bash
python backup.py --dry-run
# Verify: No files created in backups/
```

**3. Rotation Logic**
```bash
# Create 10 backups manually (old timestamps)
# Run backup with MIN_BACKUPS_TO_KEEP=3
# Verify: Only 4 backups remain (3 old + 1 new)
```

**4. Error Handling**
```bash
# Test with non-existent source
python backup.py --sources /nonexistent /tmp/test1
# Verify: Continues processing, logs error
```

**5. CLI Overrides**
```bash
python backup.py --retention-days 1
# Verify: Uses 1 day instead of .env value
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required environment variables"
**Solution:** Create `.env` file with all required variables.

### "Backup source does not exist"
**Solution:** Verify paths in `BACKUP_SOURCES` are correct and absolute.

### "Backup destination not writable"
**Solution:** Check permissions on `BACKUP_DESTINATION` directory.

### "Compressing failed"
**Solution:** Ensure `tar` command is available (`which tar`).

### No backups deleted during rotation
**Solution:** Check if backups are actually older than `RETENTION_DAYS`.

## Project Files

**`backup.py`** - Main script with backup logic and CLI  
**`config.py`** - Configuration loading and validation  
**`.env`** - Environment variables (not committed)  
**`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies  
**`.gitignore`** - Excludes logs, backups, .env  
**`logs/backup.log`** - Application log file  
**`backups/`** - Backup destination directory  

---

## Dependencies

```
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

No other external dependencies required! Uses Python standard library:
- `subprocess` - Shell command execution
- `logging` - Application logging
- `datetime` - Timestamp handling
- `hashlib` - SHA256 checksums
- `json` - Manifest serialization
- `pathlib` - Path operations
- `argparse` - CLI parsing

---

## Security Considerations

🔒 **Never commit `.env` files** - Contains sensitive paths  
🔒 **Validate all paths** - Prevent directory traversal  
🔒 **Check permissions** - Ensure read/write access before operations  
🔒 **Use absolute paths** - Avoid ambiguity with relative paths  
🔒 **Sanitize inputs** - Especially if accepting user paths
